# Verified Token

## Purpose
This is a private repo for drafting documentation, code examples, and the EIP specification prior to submission to Ethereum Foundation. A tidy public repo will be created at the time of publication.

### As Per ERC20:
`totalSupply`
`BalanceOf`
`Approve`
`Allowance`

### Modifed ERC20:
`setIntermediary` - Sets Intermediary for AllowedRegistry, RequiredClaims, AllowedIssuers and ClaimsNeeded

`transfer` - check through the AllowedRegistry for all RequiredClaims made by AllowedIssuers for the _to address and counts each entry and transfers only once that count has exceeded ClaimsNeeded

`transferFrom` - checks through the AllowedRegistry for all RequiredClaims made by AllowedIssuers for the _to address and counts each entry and transfers only once that count has exceeded ClaimsNeeded

`balanceAtBlockHeight` (optional)

### Verified Token Interface Contract

`setAllowedRegistry` - sets an array of ERC780 (or 780 like Smart Contract) contract addresses that this contract will check on transfer
(OnlyOwner)

`setAllowedVerifiers` - sets an array of Verifiers that the this contract will check on transfer 
(OnlyOwner)

`setRequiredClaims` - sets an array of key pair mappings that this contract is checking for on transfer
(OnlyOwner)

`setClaimsNeeded` - sets how many of the AllowedRegistry need to return the RequiredClaim for a transfer to be valid
(Only Owner)

## Broader Context

There are standards that we overlap with in some way - letâ€™s read & learn from the comments refining each of them. My current thinking is that we propose our Verified Token Standard as an extension to ERC #20, #223, & #721
